										<h3 class="major">Statistical analysis</h3>
                    					<p>I began developing my statistical skills during my MSc studies at the Biological Station of Do√±ana (EBD-CSIC), where I enrolled in an advanced course on statistics in R taught by Roger Mundry, an expert in statistical modelling. This course provided me with a solid foundation in generalised and linear models. During this period, I also acquired basic training in ArcGIS, including programming, coordinate systems, and georeferencing, by completing a specialised course at EBD-CSIC.</p>
										<p>My statistical expertise deepened significantly during my PhD, where I built a strong background in the use of R, applying a range of techniques such as meta-analysis, generalised linear mixed models, and phenotypic trajectory analysis. I benefited from the support of Prof. Andrew Beckerman (University of Sheffield, UK), co-author of <i>Getting Started with R: An Introduction for Biologists</i>. In addition, I expanded my skills to genomic data analysis by taking courses such as <i>Environmental Genomics</i> and  <i>Introduction to Metabolomics for Environmental Scientists </i> at the University of Birmingham. These trainings, combined with my thesis work, gave me hands-on experience in bioinformatic, byt the analsysi and handle of complex genomic database (data extracted from Daphnia experiments, DNA and RNA), population genomics, SNP calling, outlier detection, and GWAS analysis.</p>
										<p>During my first postdoctoral position, I further strengthened my statistical expertise by assembling high-resolution ecological datasets. This involved the collection and analysis of ecosystem parameters over an eight-month period using automated multiparameter sondes, which necessitated robust statistical treatment. In my second postdoctoral position, I gained extensive experience with large-scale, long-term datasets spanning eight different countries. In my current research, I focused on advanced methods such as multifunctionality analysis, structural equation modeling, and network analysis. To consolidate and expand this expertise, I conducted a research stay with Prof. Manuel Delgado-Baquerizo (IRNAS-CSIC, Seville), a leading expert in multifunctionality and ecological statistical analysis.</p>

										<h3 class="major">Illustration skills</h3>
                    					<p>A well-designed figure is one of the most powerful tools for communicating science. Often, it is the figures in a paper that first capture our attention and guide us to the key findings and continuing reading the entire document. For this reason, I always try to create figures and plots that are self-explanatory, visually appealing, and informative, ensuring that illustrations not only support understanding but also enhance the overall aesthetics of a manuscript.</p>
										<p>For the creation of the figures, I always use <a href="https://inkscape.app/"><b>Inkscape</b></a>, a free software, really friendly and highly recommended.</p>
										<p><b>Here, some examples</b></p>

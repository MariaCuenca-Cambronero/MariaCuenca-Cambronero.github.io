										<h3 class="major">PONDERFUL</h3>
                    					<p>The overarching aim of the <a href="https://www.ponderful.eu"><u>PONDERFUL</u></a> project was to support the improved implementation of ponds and pondscapes as Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) for climate change (CC) mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity conservation, and the delivery of ecosystem functions and services. This goal was achieved through the generation of integrated knowledge on biodiversity, ecosystems, social and economic factors, and policy frameworks, by collecting data on pond ecosystems at both local and international scales. The project was structured around three main objectives: 1) to quantify the contribution of networks of ponds (“pondscapes”) to climate change mitigation and adaptation, and to assess how they deliver key ecosystem services, both directly, and indirectly through enhanced biodiversity conservation; 2) to identify opportunities, cost-effectiveness, and barriers for implementing pond-based NBS for climate adaptation and mitigation; 3) to build the social and ecological knowledge needed to guide the practical implementation of climate-resilient pond systems and pondscapes as blue infrastructure. A major strength of PONDERFUL was its large-scale, stratified sampling campaign, conducted across eight countries in Europe (Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, the UK) and one in Latin America (Uruguay).</p>
										<p>As part of this project, I led the field sampling campaign in Spain and the data analysis for Work Package 2 (WP2), which aimed to determine how biodiversity, ecosystem state and processes, and ecosystem services (ES) co-vary and interact in ponds and pondscapes across broad climatic gradients. WP2 also investigated how climate change may alter the interrelationships between biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and service provision. My specific focus was on the biodiversity–ecosystem function (B–EF) relationship and how it varies across gradients of land use and aridity. The results of this work are presented in a manuscript currently under review in Nature Ecology & Evolution. Our findings provide strong evidence that biodiversity makes a significant positive contribution to ecosystem multifunctionality in small, standing freshwater bodies, particularly in arid regions. Furthermore, we found that multiple ecosystem functions are negatively associated with nutrient levels, highlighting the potential benefits of conserving and restoring pond biodiversity to maintain critical ecosystem functions in the context of global environmental change.</p>

										<h3 class="major">SeeWandel</h3>
                    								<p>SeeWandel aims to improve our ability to assess biodiversity and ecosystem change in overlooked and valuable pond ecosystems by optimising tools and developing protocols for biodiversity monitoring (Fig. 1 - Graphical representation of the project). This involves establishing approaches to select sites for monitoring, standardising, and automating the monitoring procedures in a transnational context. It also aims to create a network for exchanging expertise and sharing expectations and thus increase the impact of the project across a wide range of stakeholders and policy managers.</p>
										<p>TRANSPONDER consists of four work packages (Fig. 2 – Different packages of the project): WP1 capitalises on existing data, targeted field work and novel methodological approaches across seven European countries to develop and optimise a standardised methodology to assess the biodiversity of ponds. WP2 focuses on how enhanced automation, fostering high-throughput analyses, can be integrated into assessments of pond biodiversity. WP3 focuses on the development of generally applicable monitoring protocols. WP4 will engage stakeholders at both the regional and European levels, raising the profile of ponds and their key role in biodiversity conservation and policy.</p>

                    					<p>PONDERFUL is part of an international consortium, coordinated from UVic, Sapin, which integrates 12 different institutions and 10 countries, including: Spain, France, Belgium, Switzerland, Denmark, Germany, Sweden, UK, Turkey and Uruguay</p>
										<p>The overarching aim of the <a href="https://www.ponderful.eu"><u><b>PONDERFUL</b></u></a> project was to support the improved implementation of ponds and pondscapes as Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) for climate change (CC) mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity conservation, and the delivery of ecosystem functions and services. This goal was achieved through the generation of integrated knowledge on biodiversity, ecosystems, social and economic factors, and policy frameworks, by collecting data on pond ecosystems at both local and international scales. The project was structured around three main objectives: 1) to quantify the contribution of networks of ponds (“pondscapes”) to climate change mitigation and adaptation, and to assess how they deliver key ecosystem services, both directly, and indirectly through enhanced biodiversity conservation; 2) to identify opportunities, cost-effectiveness, and barriers for implementing pond-based NBS for climate adaptation and mitigation; 3) to build the social and ecological knowledge needed to guide the practical implementation of climate-resilient pond systems and pondscapes as blue infrastructure. A major strength of PONDERFUL was its large-scale, stratified sampling campaign, conducted across eight countries in Europe (Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, the UK) and one in Latin America (Uruguay).</p>
										<p>As part of this project, <b>I led the field sampling campaign in Spain and the data analysis for Work Package 2 (WP2)</b>, which aimed to determine how biodiversity, ecosystem state and processes, and ecosystem services (ES) co-vary and interact in ponds and pondscapes across broad climatic gradients. WP2 also investigated how climate change may alter the interrelationships between biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and service provision. My specific focus was on the biodiversity–ecosystem function (B–EF) relationship and how it varies across gradients of land use and aridity. The results of this work are presented in a manuscript currently under review in Nature Ecology & Evolution. Our findings provide strong evidence that biodiversity makes a significant positive contribution to ecosystem multifunctionality in small, standing freshwater bodies, particularly in arid regions. Furthermore, we found that multiple ecosystem functions are negatively associated with nutrient levels, highlighting the potential benefits of conserving and restoring pond biodiversity to maintain critical ecosystem functions in the context of global environmental change.</p>

										<p><a href="https://seewandel.org/en/start-en/"><u><b>SeeWandel</b></u></a>: Life in Lake Constance – the past, present and future,  investigates the impacts of nutrient decline, climate change, non-native species, and other stressors on the Lake Constance ecosystem, its biodiversity, and functioning, as well as the use of lake resources by people.</p>
										<p>Within this project, <b>I was involved in sub-project</b> <a href="https://seewandel.org/en/l13-eng/"><u><b>L13</b></u></a>, which focused on the ecology and diversity of stickleback in Lake Constance. The goal was to identify the ecological and evolutionary processes underlying the abundance, distribution, and phenotypic variation of stickleback in the lake. My work examined the effects of different eutrophication histories on zooplankton communities using 15,000 artificial pond mesocosms. I further assessed how these communities responded to the introduction of stickleback fish with different evolutionary trajectories, exploring the links between evolutionary background, species interactions, and community structure.</p>

                    					<p>The ponds are located within the <a href="https://ceinr.cat/serra-cavallera-3/"><u><b>Natural Protected Area of Serra Cavallera</b></u></a> (see the <a href="https://mediambient.gencat.cat/web/.content/home/ambits_dactuacio/patrimoni_natural/senp_catalunya/el_sistema/xarxa_natura_2000/xarxa_natura_2000_a_catalunya/mapes_1_50000/girona/mapes/es5120003.pdf"><u><b>map</b></u></a>). This location benefits from the monitoring and management support provided by the Consortium of the Natural Park, which is primarily overseen by the Catalan Government. However, part of the surrounding land is under private ownership and management by local farmers, creating a mosaic of public and private stewardship.</p>
										<p>Due to its geographic location and the high abundance of natural ponds and water sources, the area has historically been used by farmers for free-ranging cattle grazing. However, in recent decades, the intensification of livestock activity and the increase in cattle numbers have led to significant environmental degradation, including the loss and deterioration of many ponds. These changes have compromised the ecological integrity of the area, reducing habitat quality and biodiversity associated with Mediterranean pond ecosystems.</p>

														<td>Creu de Pedra I</td>
														<td>This pond is currently covered by excessive terrestrial vegetation, and a small wooden wall previously installed for water retention has proven ineffective. Restoration actions will involve the removal of approximately 100 m³ of accumulated sediment and terrestrial vegetation. The existing wooden barrier will be improved or replaced with a small concrete wall designed to retain water while allowing limited outflow. An electric fence powered by a solar panel will be installed to regulate the fence. Livestock access will be allowed twice per year, in spring and summer, where water is more limited. In addition to ensuring livestock access to water without impacting the pond, an adjacent drinking trough will be installed. This structure will be set on a stable concrete base and integrated into the surrounding landscape using local materials.</td>

														<td>Creu de Pedra II</td>
														<td>This pond is also covered by terrestrial vegetation. Restoration activities will include the removal of approximately 200 m³ of sediment and vegetation to restore pond depth and open water surface. An electric fence will be installed to prevent excessive livestock intrusion, with a gated access allowing controlled grazing for one week during spring and summer, ensuring vegetation control without causing habitat degradation.</td>

													<tr>
														<td>Tarter</td>
														<td> The restoration actions proposed for the Tarter Pond will focus on recovering its ecological function and improving habitat quality for aquatic biodiversity. Historically, the Tarter Pond served as a permanent freshwater body of high biological interest, hosting species such as Potamogeton natans, a macrophyte considered rare in Catalonia. However, following an earthquake in the early 2000s, a subsurface fissure likely formed in the bedrock, causing significant water loss and converting the pond from permanent to temporary. Since then, the site has experienced progressive desiccation, sediment accumulation, and degradation caused by unrestricted livestock access during the summer grazing period. Planned Actions will focus on the excavation and reshaping of the basin. Approximately 500 m³ of accumulated sediment will be removed to restore the pond’s original depth and enhance water retention capacity. Excavation will be conducted using light machinery to minimise disturbance to surrounding vegetation. Additionally, control of livestock access will be performed through an electric fence. This measure will prevent trampling and eutrophication while allowing occasional controlled grazing to maintain vegetation balance.</td>

													</tr>
													<tr>
														<td>Barbs</td>
														<td>The pond is currently dominated by Typha latifolia, whose annual senescence caused excessive organic matter accumulation, resulting in anoxic conditions and poor habitat quality. Restoration measures will include the mechanical removal of excess Typha and organic sediment from the pond bottom to re-establish open-water zones and oxygenated conditions. The existing wooden fence will be replaced with a solar-powered electric fence, including a controlled-access gate to allow limited cattle entry for short periods to manage vegetation growth.</td>

													<tr>
														<td>La Llaguna</td>
														<td>This site consists of three small ponds that have been significantly degraded due to excessive sediment accumulation and intensive cattle use. Restoration efforts will focus on increasing pond depth through the removal of accumulated sediments and invasive vegetation. To promote the recovery of native aquatic and riparian vegetation, sediment containing a natural seed bank, extracted from other restored ponds, will be strategically deposited around the buffer zones of the ponds. Additionally, partial electric fencing will be installed to regulate livestock access which will limit overgrazing and trampling pressure while still allowing controlled, periodic grazing to maintain vegetation structure and ecological balance.</td>

													</tr>
													<tr>
														<td>Pou del Taga</td>
														<td>Originally constructed as an artificial drinking point for livestock, this pond will be naturalised to support greater ecological function. Restoration will involve increasing native aquatic vegetation, creating shallow zones and refuge habitats for amphibians and invertebrates, and improving water retention to maintain a semi-permanent hydrological regime.</td>
